# Expo Linking API Silent Failure

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, issue with Expo's `Linking` API. The problem lies in the silent failure to open deep links if the URL scheme isn't correctly registered or handled. The app won't crash or throw an error; it simply won't respond to the deep link.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app on an emulator or device.
4. Try to open a deep link (e.g., `myapp://somepath`). The app may not open, or the intended navigation within the app will fail.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking the app's configuration and handling of URL schemes and `Linking.addEventListener` to ensure that the app correctly listens and responds to the intended deep links.
